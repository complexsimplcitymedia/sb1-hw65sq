      question: "How long does a vehicle wrap typically last?",
      answer: "A professional vehicle wrap typically lasts 5-7 years with proper care and maintenance. We offer a 1-year labor warranty on our wrap installations."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a wrap and paint?",
      answer: "While both can transform your vehicle's appearance, wraps offer more design flexibility, are typically more cost-effective, protect the original paint, and can be removed without damage. Paint provides a traditional finish and might be preferred for certain custom looks."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the installation process take?",
      answer: "A full vehicle wrap typically takes 3-5 business days, while partial wraps may take 1-2 days. Custom paint jobs usually require 5-7 days. Timeline can vary based on design complexity and vehicle size."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I wash my wrapped vehicle?",
      answer: "Yes, but we recommend hand washing with pH-neutral car soap. Avoid automatic car washes with brushes. Wait at least 2 weeks after installation before the first wash."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer warranties?",
      answer: "Yes, we provide a 1-year labor warranty on wrap installations, 6-month warranty on basic paint jobs, and 1-year warranty on premium paint jobs. These warranties cover installation-related issues under normal use conditions."
    },
    {
      question: "What types of vehicles do you work with?",
      answer: "We work with all vehicle types including cars, trucks, SUVs, motorcycles, boats, and commercial fleet vehicles. Our facility can accommodate vehicles of various sizes."
    },
    {
      question: "How should I maintain my wrapped vehicle?",
      answer: "Keep your vehicle clean, hand wash with appropriate products, avoid parking in direct sunlight for prolonged periods, clean bird droppings and other contaminants promptly, and follow our detailed care guide."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you wrap leased vehicles?",
      answer: "Yes, vehicle wraps can be safely removed without damaging the original paint, making them perfect for leased vehicles. Just ensure your lease agreement allows for temporary modifications."
